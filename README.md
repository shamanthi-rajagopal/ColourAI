# ColourAI
A simple JavaScript application that inludes HTML & CSS and brain.js to train the neural network to identify when black or white text is better on a randomized colour. The learning model is trained with it's own data after providing it with the correct answers. This is a fun little project to get started on AI & machine learning concepts.
